# FUTURE_UIUX_TaskNumber
I created a complete Food Website UI design in Figma with a focus on modern aesthetics, smooth navigation, and an engaging user experience. The goal of this project was to design a platform that feels both visually appetizing and highly functional, giving users a seamless journey from browsing food items to placing an order.
